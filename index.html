        <p>Having worked near a decade in the games industry as a manual QA Tester on titles such as The Sims 3, Heroes of Dragon Age, and Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Originally studied animation at The Art Institute of California-San Francisco, got into the games industry back when QA was considered an entry level position with Electronic Arts in 2008. </p>
        <p>Detail oriented test case and test plan creation, taking into account how features link into each other, code complexity, network connections, and utilizing XML and working with apache server to create time sensitive test scenarios that could be tested quickly and ensure issues found with time to fix before release.</p>
        <p>Currently working toward expanding technical skills to be able to automate tests that would otherwise take too much time to be tested manually, find major issues sooner, and ensure better test coverage.</p>
